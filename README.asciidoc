Installation
------------

For installation there must be PostgreSQL dev environment installed
and pg_config in the PATH.   Then just run:

	$ make
	$ make install

To run regression tests:

	$ make installcheck

Notes:

* Encoding regression test fails if the Postres instance is not created with C locale.
  It can be considered expected failure then.

* Location to pg_config can be set via PG_CONFIG variable:

	$ make PG_CONFIG=/path/to/pg_config
	$ make install PG_CONFIG=/path/to/pg_config
	$ make installcheck PG_CONFIG=/path/to/pg_config
